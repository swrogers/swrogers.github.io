&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve decided to go ahead and give this blogging thing another go. There was, at one point in my life, where I had something of an ambition to become a writer. I had all kinds of grandiose ideas to create some amazing science fiction fantasy world, even nearly filling a single subject binder full of some cool, interesting (to me, anyhow) space faring tale. It was probably going to win the next big award.&amp;nbsp;Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really though. Life takes its strange twists and turns, and I fully believe that you wind up right where you were meant to be. For me, that is working in a technical field and constantly trying to better myself and my skills. But, does that mean that I have to give up writing? Heck no. Over the past few years, I have written for online websites (mostly Android related, and mostly game related at that) though it has been a few years since I&amp;#8217;ve done that. So I figure that it&amp;#8217;s time to dust the cobwebs off - both my writing and my&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one can do the proverbial two birds with one stone, then that&amp;#8217;s all fine by me. I have been meaning to pick up some Javascript, so when one of the more popular courses on Udemy was included in a recent sale (of which, they have them &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;) I figured &amp;#8220;why not&amp;#8221;. At the time, I was also looking at creating a static pages blog with &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;, so here we are. Might as well combine the two and I can use this to track some progress. Eventually, I would like to get to where I can write more about my journey and, who knows, maybe even teach somebody&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="writing"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="starting"></category></entry><entry><title>First Post</title><link href="https://swrogers.github.io/first-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Shane Rogers</name></author><id>tag:swrogers.github.io,2019-08-22:/first-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The First&amp;nbsp;Post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go&amp;nbsp;again&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Header&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this working?
Because I don&amp;#8217;t think&amp;nbsp;so&lt;/p&gt;
