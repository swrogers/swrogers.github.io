			<h1>Here we go&nbsp;again!</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and give this blogging thing another go. There was, at one point in my life, where I had something of an ambition to become a writer. I had all kinds of grandiose ideas to create some amazing science fiction fantasy world, even nearly filling a single subject binder full of some cool, interesting (to me, anyhow) space faring tale. It was probably going to win the next big award.&nbsp;Probably.</p>
<p>Not really though. Life takes its strange twists and turns, and I fully believe that you wind up right where you were meant to be. For me, that is working in a technical field and constantly trying to better myself and my skills. But, does that mean that I have to give up writing? Heck no. Over the past few years, I have written for online websites (mostly Android related, and mostly game related at that) though it has been a few years since I&#8217;ve done that. So I figure that it&#8217;s time to dust the cobwebs off - both my writing and my&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>If one can do the proverbial two birds with one stone, then that&#8217;s all fine by me. I have been meaning to pick up some Javascript, so when one of the more popular courses on Udemy was included in a recent sale (of which, they have them <em>all the time</em>) I figured &#8220;why not&#8221;. At the time, I was also looking at creating a static pages blog with <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">pelican</a>, so here we are. Might as well combine the two and I can use this to track some progress. Eventually, I would like to get to where I can write more about my journey and, who knows, maybe even teach somebody&nbsp;something.</p>
